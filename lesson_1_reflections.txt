Kaleb - This is a test line.

1. How did viewing a diff between two version of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

diff gave me the tools neccessary to see exactly what lines were altered in comparing the former with the later of game.js.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having the histroy lets one go back and see what changes were detrimental to the program.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosting when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically save like google docs does?

pros-You Won't have an over abundance of versions saved with little to no changes made to them.

cons- You might forget to commit a version.

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log can be used to determine at what point certain changes were made and diff can tell exactly were in the file were the changes made.

6. How might using versison control make you more confident to make changes that could break something.

I would definitely be more confident knowing I am able to go back to previous version whenever necessary.
